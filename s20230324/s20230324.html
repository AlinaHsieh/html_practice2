        <h3>Taylor Swift: Anti-Hero</h3>
        I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser<br>
        Midnights become my afternoons<br>
        When my depression works the graveyard shift<br>
        All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room<br>
        I should not be left to my own devices<br>
        They come with prices and vices<br>
        I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)<br>
        I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
        One day I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
        'Cause you got tired of my scheming<br>
        (For the last time)<br>
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
        At tea time, everybody agrees<br>
        I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror<br>
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
        Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby<br>
        And I'm a monster on the hill<br>
        Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city<br>
        Pierced through the heart, but never killed<br>
        Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism<br>
        Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)<br>
        I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
        One day I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
        And life will lose all its meaning<br>
        (For the last time)<br>
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
        At tea time, everybody agrees<br>
        I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror<br>
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
        I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money<br>
        She thinks I left them in the will<br>
        The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out<br>
        "She's laughing up at us from hell"<br>
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
        It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees<br>
        It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
        At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)<br>
        I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror<br>
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
